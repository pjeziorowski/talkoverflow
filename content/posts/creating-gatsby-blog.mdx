Hello! Do you know [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)? He's the creator of popular Javascript `react-redux` library
and a member of the core React team. 

In this post, we will create and deploy a blog based on his site - [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io)
using **React**, **Gatsby** and its **server-side rendering/graphQL features** in less than **10 minutes**!

## Our goal:
<Image src="../assets/overreacted.jpg" alt="Overreacted.io" />
<br />

## Prerequisites
If you don't have yet `node` installed on your system, follow appropriate installation instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Let's begin!
First thing we need to do is to install `gatsby-cli`:
```bash
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

<br />

Now we can bootstrap the project
```bash
gatsby new blazing-fast-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

<br />

This command clones the project template and prepares a development environment.

After it's done, we can start the application:
```bash
cd blazing-fast-blog ; gatsby develop
```

Our page should be up and running in a few seconds.

Check if it's running - [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

When it's up, you can also take a quick look at the **GraphQL data explorer** running here -> [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) 

It's not relevant for us for now, but it's very handy during the development (it only runs for the development version of the site of course).

We need to make a few quick adjustments:

- open `gatsby-config.json`

It's a file where we can configure our Gatsby site - we can add & configure plugins or define site metadata.

For now, you can adjust the `title`, `author` and `description` in the `siteMetadata` section.

After you're done with adjusting `siteMetadata`, open `src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/colors.js`

Here you can overshadow the default theme colours.

Replace the `src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/colors.js` file content with: 
```js
import merge from "deepmerge"
import defaultThemeColors from "gatsby-theme-blog/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/colors"

const darkBackground = `#282B35`
const darkPrimary = `#F9A6C4`
const lightBackground = `#FFFFFF`
const lightPrimary = `#D23669`

export default merge(defaultThemeColors, {
 primary: lightPrimary,
 lightBackground: lightBackground,
 modes: {
 dark: {
 background: darkBackground,
 primary: darkPrimary,
 },
 },
})
```

Save the changes. Now, navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and compare with [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io)

Quite nice for a couple of minutes of work, huh? **We got a nice foundation for further customizations and development of our site**.

By editing the `colors.js` file we used Gatsby's concept of theme **shadowing**, but before we go through Gatsby details, let's deploy our site!

## Deployment
We'll use `Netlify` - it gives us a **CI/CD pipeline, SSL, custom domain, hosting and integration with GitHub for free**.
Everything happens kinda automagically - for me, their free plan is a steal!

## How does the process of publishing a new version of site look like?

1. You edit your site/create new content
2. You commit and push to your GitHub repository
3. Netlify detects new commits, builds the page, runs tests & deploys a new version seamlessly

First thing we need to do to deploy our site, is to create a new repository on our GitHub account.
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com), log in and create a new repository



After creating a new GitHub repository, in terminal navigate to our project folder.

**Then, commit & push the changes to the newly created GitHub repository** (with proper YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME):
```bash
git add . 
git commit -m "Initial structure"
git remote add origin https://github.com/${YOUR_USERNAME}/${REPO_NAME}.git 
git push -u origin master
```

<br />

Now it's time to navigate to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and register & log in

When you're logged in, navigate to your `Profile` -> `Sites`

<Image src="../assets/netlify-sites.jpg" alt="Netlify Sites" />

<br />

Click `New site from Git`

Choose GitHub & authorize
<Image src="../assets/netlify-github.jpg" alt="Netlify Github" />

<br />

After authorization, a list of repositories should appear:
<Image src="../assets/netlify-repos.jpg" alt="Netlify Github" />
<br />


If you don't see your new repository, click `Configure the Netlify app on GitHub` and grant Netlify access to your repository

After you're done with this, select your repository from the list.

In next step, simply click `Deploy site`
<Image src="../assets/deploy-netlify.jpg" alt="Netlify Deploy" />
<br />

And that's all! After a minute, your site will be up and running. You can check its URL here:
<Image src="../assets/netlify-url.jpg" alt="Netlify Url" />
<br />

Done & Deployed!
<Image src="../assets/netlify-deployed.jpg" alt="Netlify Deploy" />

<br />

If you have a custom domain, you can follow instructions from **2nd step of Getting started on Netlify**
and use your domain instead.

## Conclusions
In this post, in a couple of minutes, we created overreacted.io-like blog and deployed it to Netlify.
We got a solid foundation for customizations and **possibility of learning React, GraphQL & Gatsby while maintaining our blog**.
