# Introduction
<Image src="../assets/golang.png" alt="Golang" />

<br />

**Go** is a modern programming language that is very simple and quick to learn. It makes full use of the power of today’s multicore computer processors, so your programs run very fast.

Over 10 years ago Google had a big problem - they had to maintain programs with millions of code. When they wanted to test a new change, they had to spend a lot of time compiling the code and turning it into a runnable process. It was a nightmare for developers and huge productivity loss.

To solve the issue, Google engineers **Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson** sketched out some goals for a new language:
- Fast compilation
- Less cumbersome code
- Unused memory freed automatically (garbage collection)
- Easy-to-write software that does several operations simultaneously (concurrency)
- Good support for processors with multiple cores

After years of work, Googe come up with **Golang – a simple, productive language that is very fast to write, compile and run.** Go went open-source in 2009 and is free to use for everyone now.

Golang is capable of writing web servers that handle multiple concurrent users connections at the same time. You can also create command-line tools for Window, macOS and Linux from the same source code. No matter what you are willing to do, Go will help you write more with less, simpler and easier to maintain code.

# Run your first program
Go team has prepared an online environment for running simple Go programs on their servers. To run your first program:

1. Go to https://play.golang.org/
2. Click the Run button

You should see **Hello, playground** displayed at the bottom of the screen. Congratulations! You’ve just run your first Go app.

# Let’s explain the code
It’s the time to explain what all the code means.

Each file in Go starts with a **package clause**. A package is just a collection of related code. The package clause determines to which package the code belongs to.

Next, most of Go files have a few **import statements**. Here you declare packages that you use so that your programs load an compile quickly. You don't want to include everything in your program! Go compiler will not let you import packages that you don't use, which is great!

<br/>

The last part is the code which is usually split up into **functions**. 

A **function** is a block of code that you can run from other places in your program. Similarly to Java, Go always look for the **main function** and runs that first, that’s why we called our function main.

As you can see in the playground, there is a **Format** button. When you click that button, Go compiler will adjust your code to the **standard Go formatting**. In Java, there are many disputes on styling conventions, and Go solves that problem with providing an official styling. That's very nice!

One more interesting thing you may notice is the **lack of semicolons**. In fact, in Go they are optional – you may use them to separate the statements, but it’s not required and generally not advised to use.

# Function that returns a value
If you execute the following code:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
)

func main() {
    math.Floor(3.14)
}
```

You'll notice that it does not print anything. This is because the math.Floor() function only **returns a value**, but nothing prints it.

The math.Floor() function takes a floating-point number, rounds it down to the nearest whole number, and returns that whole number.

To see the result of math.Floor(), we need to use the fmt.Println() function to print it to the screen:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(math.Floor(3.14))
}
```

# Strings
In our first program, we used a *string* as an argument to *Println*. A **string** is a series of bytes that represent text. You can define strings directly within your code using **string literals**: a text in between double quotation marks like "Hello, playground".

# Runes
Go introduces a concept of **Runes**. While strings are used to represent a sequence of characters, **runes are used to represent a single character**.

If you want to use a Rune, you have to surround a character with single quotation marks like 'A'. Go uses the Unicode standard for storing runes, so they can store any character on the earth.

# Booleans
**Bool** value represent one of the two - true or false. They are very useful in conditional statements - similarly to all other programming languages.

# Numbers
All you have to do is just to type a number. Golang treats integers and floating-point numbers as different types - a decimal point is used to determine if it's an integer or float.

# Types
**Go is statically typed** - the **type of each variable is known at the compilation time**. Functions expects arguments to be of particular type. They also return values of previously defined type. If you use incorrect type, the Golang compiler will let you know even before you run the program.

# Declaring variables
A variable is a piece of storage containing a value. You can give a variable a name by using a variable declaration.

Just use the var keyword followed by the name and type of the value:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    var myVariable int // var VARIABLE_NAME TYPE

    myVariable = 25

    fmt.Println(myVariable)
}
```

You can also declare a variable and give it a value in the same line:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    var myVariable int = 25

    fmt.Println(myVariable)
}
```

**You can assign a new value to an existing variable but it needs to be of the same type!**

<br/>

# Zero values
If you don't provide a value to the variable, it will contain **Zero Value** of its type.

For numeric types, zero value is 0. For bool, it's false. For strings - an empty string.

# Short variable declaration
If you know beforehand the value of variable, then you can use a **short form of creating vars**.

1

**the := operator** declares and assigns a value to a variable at the same time. Using this form you don't have to provide the type of variable - the compiler will figure that out based on the value you passed.

# Naming rules
Go has a set of naming rules that you'll have to follow:
- a name must begin with a letter
- if the name begins with a Capital letter, it's considered as **exported** and can be used **outside of the current package**. Otherwise, the variable/function/type can be used **only inside the current package. THIS IS IMPORTANT!**

These are all enforced rules. Simple!

One more additional rule set by the community is to use **camelCase**. It is also popular to abbreviate obvious variables - using i instead of index etc. That's all you need to know about naming conventions.

# Compiling Go code
Go code cannot be run directly. It has to be compiled to a binary format that your CPU understands. To do so, we need first to install Go:
- Visit https://golang.org/dl/
- Download package appropriate to your system
- Follow the installation instructions page for your OS
- Open a terminal/console
- Execute `go version`. Version of Golang installed on your computer should be printed in the response.

Now, you're are ready to create a Go program on your computer. Create a file named `helloworld.go` and copy-paste the content of our first Hello World program from online Go playground. Then, save the file. Now:
- Run `go build helloworld.go` to compile the program. This will create an executable file.
- Run the executable. On macOS/Linux just type `./helloworld`, on Windows probably `helloworld.exe`

# Conclusions
Nice! In this introductory post, you've compiled and executed a Go application on your computer. You've also learnt the basics of the language. You're definitely ready to play with Golang to learn more! In next posts we'll introduce more advanced concepts of the language.
