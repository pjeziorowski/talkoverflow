Strategy is a behavioural pattern that defines an API for a family of algorithms that can be interchangeable.

## When to use
- when you need different versions of a given algorithm
- when you want to encapsulate code of given family of algorithms

## Elements
- Strategy - defines the API of family of algorithms
- ConcreteStragegy - implementation of given Strategy
- Context - is configured by concrete strategy, keeps a reference to strategy

## Cooperation
Clients usually create a concrete strategy and pass it to the Context.
Context uses Strategy and gives it all needed data to complete the algorithm.

## Consequences
- creates a family of related algorithms
- is an alternative for creating subclasses of context to provide different implementation of algorithm
- enables changing implementation during the runtime
- the client has to know possible strategies

## Simple code example
Strategy pattern is very easy to implement. All you need to do is to provide some abstraction and use inheritance to implement it.
Then, the client can use any implementation of that abstraction.

Let's first declare our abstraction:

```java
public interface Abstraction {
    void saySomething();
}
```

In next step we'll provide two implementations:

```java
public class SillyImplementation implements Abstraction{
    @Override
    public void saySomething() {
        System.out.println("Chuck Norris simply walks into Mordor");
    }
}

public class SmartImplementation implements Abstraction {
    @Override
    public void saySomething() {
        System.out.println("Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds");
    }
}
```

We implemented the abstraction twice - first implementation prints some silly Chuck Norris joke and the second a quote of Albert Einstein.

Now, both implementations can be used in the place of abstraction in the client code:

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Abstraction abstraction = new SillyImplementation();

        abstraction.saySomething();

        abstraction = new SmartImplementation();

        abstraction.saySomething();
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Chuck Norris simply walks into Mordor
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
```
