## High level overview
OOP (object-oriented programming) gurus once concluded that it's pointless to reinvent the wheel
each time they encounter a problem in application design. Writing flexible and reusable code is hard. They knew that they should not tackle the problem from the ground up.
Instead, they gathered and categorized battle-tested approaches in structuring code that were reoccurring in many different projects. This is why in many systems, applications and frameworks we
can see repetitive class diagrams and object compositions.

Such reusable patterns are not only common in application development - take a look at literature, where themes, motifs and symbols from bible or ancient greek myths are still present in modern writings.

**Patterns that worked before are likely to work now.
This, in theory, is a promise that design patterns give us.**

Before we go through the most common patterns and finally see some code, let's discus what are they made of and how they are categorized.

## Design Pattern elements
According to [GOF](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612), a design pattern is made of 4 elements:

1. **Name** - one or two words that describe the pattern
2. **Problem description** - describes when to use a given pattern
3. **Solution** - abstract description of classes, objects and their relations in the pattern
4. **Consequences** - pros and cons of using a given pattern

## Categorization

- #### Creational
Patterns responsible for object creation.

- #### Structural
Patterns involved in the way of composing classes and objects.

- #### Behavioural 
Patterns that describe the way objects and classes work, share tasks and cooperate.

There is one more thing that splits each category from above in half
### The "Scope"

**Class-scope** - class scope pattern goals are realized at compile time using inheritance, which means they are 'static'.

**Object-scope** - their goals are achieved usually through composition during the runtime, which makes them more 'dynamic'.

Enough theory - by now you should already have a hang of design patterns. In following posts in this series we'll go through some of the most popular patterns with code examples.
