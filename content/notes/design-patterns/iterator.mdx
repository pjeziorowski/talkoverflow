## Introduction
The iterator is a behavioural design pattern that allows traversing data structures without disclosing its internal representation.

This pattern is quite common in object-oriented languages. In Java, you can create an iterator by implementing built-in [Iterator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) interface.

## When to use?
- when you want to expose access to objects in data structure without revealing its implementation
- when you want to provide interface to traverse some aggregated data structure

## Elements
- Iterator - interface allowing traversing structures of multiple elements
- ConcreteIterator - implements Iterator, tracks current position in data structure
- Aggregate - defines interface for creating Iterators
- ConcreteAggregate - implements Aggregate to return the correct type of Iterator

## Additional benefits of using Iterator
- using Iterator makes it possible to traverse data structure in different ways (by implementing the Iterator differently)
- the Aggregate API is cleaner as all stuff related to traversing its elements is extracted
